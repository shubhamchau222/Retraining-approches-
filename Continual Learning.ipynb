    "- Both classical software and ML systems process data in batches, but many modern software systems are based around streaming data. \n",

    "- In `batch processing`, data is there and you query it. In `stream processing` data might be arriving late, out of order, or it might be dropped altogether: this is mitigated by the `joiner` component.\n",

    "- The `shared infrastructure` is shown as a collection of databases.\n",

    "- The analysis can be done such as; How quickly does the most recent data-point need to become part of the model? How long does it take for data to become irrelevant? These thing need to find `the right scope of data for relevant learning at the current moment`. Generally, newer instances are more relevant, but in some cases (e.g. retail), data from the previous quarter/year are more relevant.\n",
