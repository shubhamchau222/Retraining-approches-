    "BigML is providing a selection of robust Machine Learning algorithms to solve real world problems by applying a single, standardized framework across your company or organization. BigML facilitates unlimited predictive applications across industries and using BigML many of your dependencies and complexity has been decreased using BigML APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Keep it short, it is a platform where you can build your own machine learning models without knowing much detail of implementation. They are providing APIs and using those APIs you can build entire ML model and also they have platforms available for the deployment as well. We will see step by step process to build sample model using BigML Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going to implementation part, Let's ook at some of the features:-\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Machine Learning Platform** to solve real world problems by applying a single, standardized framework across your company.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immediate Access** - you will be up and running with an easy-to-use web interface and REST API in a matter of seconds. They have free as well as paid plans for handling small as well as large/complex data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretable & Exportable Models** - This will be the great feature because All predictive models on BigML come with an interactive visualization and explainability features that make them interpretable. They can be exported and used to serve offline predictions on any edge computing device or be instantaneously deployed as part of real-time production applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration** - You can share your Machine Learning resources using team and project management capabilities of BigML.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Programmable & Repeatable** - BigML brings every new feature first to the REST API. Bindings & libraries are available for all popular languages, including Python, Node.js, Ruby, Java, Swift, and more. This will be the great fetaure for developer as to use this REST APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automation** - Rapidly bring your predictive modeling tasks to production through effective automation as BigML providing such kind of automation for executing complex workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Deployments** - BigML give options for multi-tenant and single-tenant versions on the cloud or on-premises. BigML can be ported to any cloud provider or to a Virtual Private Cloud, with fully-managed and self-managed versions.\n",
    "\n",

    "Before going to retraining of model using BigMler, there is one thing to note here:-\n",
    "\n",
    "In BigML, once a model (or any other resource) is built, it is immutable. None of its essential properties can be changed (only non-essential attributes, like their name or description, can be updated). The model keeps the information about what resources were used to build it or which configuration choices were made to get it. That ensures that all the steps that led to your actual model can be deduced i.e, the model-building workflow. By simply applying this workflow to new data you can get a retrained model.\n",

    " BigML provides a wide variety of best-in-class classification and regression algorithms including Models (CART-style decision trees), Ensembles (Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting), Logistic Regression and Deepnets. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch in a way to enhance ease of use and performance in addition to eliminating any open source dependencies. Furthermore, BigML algorithms are optimized to support large datasets by automatically supporting multi-core parallelism and multi-machine distribution while insulating the end user from such low-level infrastructure level concerns.\n",
